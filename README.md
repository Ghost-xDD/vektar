getPrice("ETH/USD")         → $3,241   ✓  (Chainlink)

getSettlementValue(tokenId) → ???      ✗  (nobody)  ← Vektar builds this
```

$20B+ sits in prediction markets. Protocols want to build on top — lending, leverage, options. Users want to exit before binary resolution. Both hit the same wall: **there is no on-chain source for what a prediction market position can actually be settled for.** Not what it's priced at. What it clears for, right now, against real order book depth.

Every 12 seconds, a CRE workflow fetches the live Polymarket order book via Confidential HTTP with BFT consensus, simulates real exit cost via VWAP, and publishes a cryptographically-signed settlement value on-chain. The fetch is TEE-shielded — no DON node sees which market is being priced. Any protocol calls `getSettlementValue(tokenId)` — a public oracle, like Chainlink price feeds but for prediction market exit liquidity.

**To prove the oracle works, we built a demo app on top of it: early exit.** Users call `earlyExit()` and receive the oracle's settlement value in USDC immediately, with payouts routed through a Convergence privacy vault — recipient, amount, and operator identity never appear on-chain. 

The oracle is the product. Early exit is one thing you can build with it.

## The Problem

A user holds $10k of "Yes" shares. The order book has $2k of buy-side depth. Their real exit value is **$2,700** — but every price oracle reports **$7,500**. Lend against price, and the loan is insolvent before it settles.

This is the **liquidity illusion**: prediction market price has no relationship to prediction market exit value. Three consequences:

**No safe collateral signal.** DeFi protocols can't use prediction market positions as collateral because no oracle reports what they're actually worth. Price says $7,500. The market can absorb $2,700. The difference is bad debt.

**No early exit.** Users can't leave before binary resolution. A "Yes" share priced at $0.80 drops to $0.00 the instant an event resolves wrong — no gradual path out. $20B+ is frozen waiting for yes/no outcomes, sometimes months away.

**No derivative layer.** Options, structured products, and leveraged positions all require a continuous, bounded, verifiable settlement signal. Binary resolution (0 or $1) can't be an underlying.

**No privacy.** Every prediction market action is fully visible on-chain — what you hold, when you exit, how much you receive. Large positions can't exit without signaling intent to the entire market. Settlement infrastructure that leaks trader activity is settlement infrastructure nobody will use at scale.

> Vektar builds the missing primitive: a settlement oracle that reads the CLOB, reports what a position can actually clear for, and keeps the entire pipeline private — from the market being priced to the payout being delivered.

---

## How It Works

Three CRE handlers, each triggered independently:

### Handler 1 — Settlement Oracle (cron, every 12s)

Fetches the Polymarket CLOB via Confidential HTTP (TEE-shielded `token_id`), reads locked collateral from Polygon, runs VWAP against live bid depth with TWOB anti-manipulation, and writes a BFT-signed settlement value to Base. The oracle tracks real exit value — not mark price:

```
T+0   Order book: $15k bids  →  Settlement: $6,300   (price says $7,500)
T+6h  Order book:  $3k bids  →  Settlement: $3,780   (price still $7,500)
T+12h Order book:   $0 bids  →  Settlement:     $0   (price still $7,500)
```

✅ `0xfa30f6...` — `updateSettlementValue` accepted by `SettlementVault.onReport()` on Tenderly.

### Handler 2 — Final Settlement (EVM log: `QuestionResolved`)

Fires automatically when UMA's CTF Adapter resolves. Decodes the event, maps `questionId` → `tokenId`, writes `settlePosition` to Base and `releaseOnSettlement` to Polygon. No manual invocation, no keeper network.

✅ Real Polygon mainnet tx `0x8ee8b5d...` (block 83622941). Both writes confirmed on Tenderly.

### Handler 3 — Private Payout (EVM log: `EarlyExitExecuted`)

Reads the user's shielded address from `SettlementVault`, loads the vault operator key from CRE secrets, signs an EIP-712 private transfer, and POSTs to the Convergence vault API with BFT consensus. Recipient, amount, and operator identity are all hidden — no on-chain link back to `earlyExit()`.

```

### Contracts

| Contract | Chain | Address |
|---|---|---|
| `CollateralEscrow.sol` | Polygon (Tenderly VNet) | `0x0C90470bFf685eFEDc03Ffff5ACBfFebb0D0cd03` |
| `SettlementVault.sol` | Base (Tenderly VNet) | `0xd09076696fb2a097c315c4de816bdafc3a893edc` |
| `DemoCompliantPrivateTokenVault` | Ethereum Sepolia | `0xE588a6c73933BFD66Af9b4A07d48bcE59c0D2d13` |
| CRE Forwarder (mock) | Base VNet | `0x5e342a8438b4f5d39e72875fcee6f76b39cce548` |

> Contract addresses are defined in `vektar-engine/config.json` — the CRE workflow reads from there. The cre-workflow `.env` addresses are for scripts and `cast call` only.

### Key Interfaces

```solidity
// CollateralEscrow.sol (Polygon)
function depositCollateral(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external;
function getLockedBalance(address user, uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);

// SettlementVault.sol (Base) — public oracle interface
function getSettlementValue(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256, uint256);
function getShieldedAddress(address user, uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
function earlyExit(uint256 tokenId) external;
function registerPosition(address user, uint256 tokenId, uint256 shares, address polygonAddress, address shieldedAddress) external;
```

### Collateral Security

Reading `balanceOf` on Polygon is exploitable: deposit shares, receive USDC on Base, transfer shares back before the next 12s cycle. `CollateralEscrow.sol` closes this window — shares lock on deposit and can only be released by the CRE DON:

```solidity
function releaseCollateral(address user, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount)
    external onlyCREForwarder  // only the CRE DON can release
```

CRE reads `getLockedBalance()` — not `balanceOf`. The position is frozen until the DON authorizes release.

### Manipulation Resistance

Spoofing requires placing fake bids on Polymarket. Three layers make it unprofitable:

| Layer | Mechanism | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **TWOB** | Oracle uses minimum liquidity over the last 5 cycles (60s) | Fake bids must persist for a full minute |
| **Rate limit** | Settlement value can increase ≤ 2% per cycle on-chain | Ramping from zero takes 37+ cycles (~7.5 min) |
| **Safety margin** | Oracle reports 90% of calculated exit liquidity | Built-in 10% haircut on every exploit attempt |

---

## Why Tenderly Virtual TestNets

A settlement oracle for prediction markets can't be tested on a blank testnet — it needs real Polymarket CTF token balances, real USDC liquidity, and real UMA resolution events. [Tenderly Virtual TestNets](https://tenderly.co/) provide exactly this: mainnet state synchronization with zero setup, so the CRE workflow operates against the same state it would in production.

### Virtual TestNets
| Chain | Virtual TestNet RPC | Explorer |
|---|---|---|
| Polygon | `https://virtual.polygon.eu.rpc.tenderly.co/4ad68571-...` | [Explorer](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer/vnet/4ad68571-6a73-406b-ad62-a169a4593612) |
| Base | `https://virtual.base.eu.rpc.tenderly.co/2e625465-...` | [Explorer](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer/vnet/2e625465-6c0e-4577-b01f-790eb8000996) |

Both configured in [`project.yaml`](apps/cre-workflow/vektar-engine/project.yaml) — the CRE simulator reads these directly.

### What Real Mainnet State Unlocks

**Handler 2 — real UMA resolution.** The `QuestionResolved` event that triggers final settlement comes from a real Polygon mainnet tx (`0x8ee8b5d...`, block 83622941). No synthetic events, no mock oracles — the CRE EVM log trigger fires on an actual historical market resolution.

**Handler 1 — real collateral reads.** The settlement oracle reads locked collateral from the Polygon Virtual TestNet. Because it's synced with mainnet state, `getLockedBalance()` returns values backed by real CTF token balances — the same values the oracle would read in production.

**Contract deployment — production-identical.** Contracts deploy to Virtual TestNets with the same gas model, precompiles, and token state as mainnet. The path from this demo to production is a config change (swap RPC URLs), not a rewrite.

### Tenderly-Specific Features Used

| Feature | How we use it |
|---|---|
| **Mainnet state sync** | Real Polymarket CTF tokens, USDC balances, and UMA events available without deploying to mainnet |
| **`tenderly_setErc20Balance`** | Admin RPC to seed USDC into `SettlementVault` for early exit payouts during demo |
| **Transaction tracing** | Full call traces for every CRE `onReport()` write — used to verify BFT-signed reports are accepted |
| **Unlimited faucet** | No gas constraints during CRE simulation — test all three handlers without funding wallets |
| **Zero-setup environment** | No local node, no genesis config — `project.yaml` points at Tenderly RPCs and the CRE simulator runs |

### CRE + Virtual TestNets Synergy

CRE workflows are inherently multi-chain — they read from one chain and write to another. Testing this without Virtual TestNets means either deploying to multiple live testnets (unreliable, no real state) or running local forks (no persistence, no explorer, no debugging). Virtual TestNets give us:

1. **Two persistent chains with real state** — Polygon and Base Virtual TestNets run simultaneously, each synced with mainnet
2. **CRE simulator connects directly** — `project.yaml` overrides point CRE at both Virtual TestNets; the simulator treats them as real chains
3. **Full observability** — every cross-chain write (settlement updates on Base, collateral releases on Polygon) is visible in the Tenderly dashboard with call traces and state diffs

---

## Privacy

| Layer | What's hidden | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Input** | `token_id`, full CLOB response | Confidential HTTP routes through TEE enclave — no DON node sees which market is being priced |
| **Keys** | `VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY` | `runtime.getSecret("vaultOperatorKey")` reads from Vault DON — never in code, logs, or on-chain |
| **Output** | Payout amount, recipient wallet, operator identity | Handler 3 POSTs to Convergence `/private-transfer` with `hide-sender`; Chainlink ACE enforces KYC/AML |

Before Vektar: any DON node log reveals which market is being priced, who called `earlyExit()`, how much they received, and where it went. After: none of it.

**ACE compliance check** — view function, no gas, live on Sepolia:

```bash
cast call 0xE588a6c73933BFD66Af9b4A07d48bcE59c0D2d13 \
  "checkWithdrawAllowed(address,address,uint256)" \
  <WHITELISTED_ADDR> 0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789 1000000000000000000 \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.sepolia.org
# Unknown address → reverts: operation_denied_by_policy
```

---

## Why CRE

This oracle requires five capabilities simultaneously. No other platform offers all of them:

| Capability | What it enables |
|---|---|
| **Confidential HTTP + BFT consensus** | Every DON node independently fetches the Polymarket CLOB through a TEE enclave. `token_id` never appears in node logs. Consensus ensures the result is as trustworthy as an on-chain read. |
| **Cross-chain reads** | CRE reads locked collateral from Polygon without bridging — native cross-chain state verification. |
| **Cross-chain writes** | Signed oracle reports with cryptographic proof, verified on-chain by the Chainlink Forwarder on Base and Polygon. |
| **Dual triggers** | Cron every 12s for continuous updates. EVM log on `QuestionResolved` for automatic final settlement — no keeper network. |
| **Secrets management** | Vault operator key lives in the CRE Vault DON. Never in code, logs, or on-chain. The only platform where credentialed offchain API calls can be orchestrated this way. |

> No bridge. Collateral stays on Polygon. Settlement executes on Base. Payouts are private.

---

## What This Enables

```solidity
// SettlementVault.sol (Base) — public oracle interface
function getSettlementValue(uint256 tokenId)
    external view
    returns (uint256 valueUSDC, uint256 lastUpdated);
```

Any protocol that calls this gets a consensus-verified, manipulation-resistant, cryptographically-proven settlement value for any active Polymarket position.

- **Prediction market lending** — LTV set by real exit value, not mark-to-market. The loan is always collateralized by what the position can actually clear for.
- **Options on prediction markets** — settlement value is bounded, continuous, and verifiable. A workable underlying in a way binary price is not.
- **Structured products** — pool prediction market positions, distribute settlement value across tranches.

Early exit is the simplest thing you can build on this oracle. It's not the most interesting.

## Challenges

### Private Payout: 1 LINK vs USDC

The Convergence privacy vault used for Handler 3 is deployed on **Ethereum Sepolia** and supports only **LINK** — not USDC. The demo therefore sends **1 LINK** as a symbolic transfer. In production, the user would receive the full oracle settlement value in USDC on Base.

**Mitigation:** The Handler 3 logic is unchanged — it reads the `payout` from the `EarlyExitExecuted` event (the oracle settlement value in USDC 6 decimals). The only demo-specific part is the transfer amount sent to the Convergence API. In production, we would either:
- Deploy the Convergence vault on Base with USDC support and use the same `payout` value directly, or
- Scale the transfer amount via a LINK/USD price feed so the recipient receives LINK-equivalent value.

The 1 LINK in the demo is a placeholder representing the USDC value the user is entitled to — the privacy architecture (shielded address, BFT consensus, ACE compliance) is unchanged.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.2+, [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/), [CRE CLI](https://docs.chain.link/cre/getting-started/cli-installation)

### Setup

```bash
bun install
cd apps/cre-workflow && cp env.template .env
# Edit .env: Tenderly RPCs, CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY
```

**Handler 3 (private payout)** — run once before testing early exit. Requires `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` with Sepolia ETH + LINK:

```bash
cd apps/cre-workflow
./setup-private-vault.sh
# Generates vault operator, funds it, deposits 1 LINK into Convergence vault, writes VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY to .env
```

**Dashboard** — copy env template and fill in (Tenderly RPCs, contract addresses, operator key to match cre-workflow):

```bash
cd apps/dashboard && cp env.template .env.local
# Edit .env.local — VITE_OPERATOR_KEY must match VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY in cre-workflow/.env
```

**Deploy your own contracts** (optional) — if not using pre-deployed addresses, run `packages/contracts/deploy-demo.sh` (testnets) or deploy to Tenderly forks with `forge script`, then `packages/contracts/update-config.sh` to sync config.json and .env files.

### Run the demo

**1. Settlement oracle (Handler 1)**

```bash
cd apps/cre-workflow
./run-normal.sh
# Expected: [TX] ✓ updateSettlementValue accepted
```

Optional — stress-test the liquidity illusion: `./run-thin.sh` then `./run-crisis.sh` (oracle drops while spot stays flat), then `./run-normal.sh` to recover.

**2. Early exit + private payout (Handler 3)** — run before Handler 2

Register a position in the dashboard, generate shielded address, click **Early Exit**, then copy the tx hash and run:

```bash
source .env
cre workflow simulate vektar-engine --non-interactive --trigger-index 2 \
  --evm-tx-hash <EARLY_EXIT_TX_HASH> --evm-event-index 1 \
  --target local-simulation --broadcast
# Expected: [PRIVATE PAYOUT] ✅ transaction_id: ...
```

> Handler 3 sends 1 LINK (Convergence vault on Sepolia supports LINK only) — see [Challenges](#challenges).

**3. Final settlement (Handler 2)** — for positions that did not early exit

```bash
cre workflow simulate vektar-engine --non-interactive --trigger-index 1 \
  --evm-tx-hash 0x8ee8b5d99c90758b31aa563c0be36e2082f7902f5ec9a2148859e7fa3eded5ec \
  --evm-event-index 1 --target local-simulation --broadcast
# Expected: settlePosition on Base ✓, releaseOnSettlement on Polygon ✓
```

**4. Verify on-chain**

```bash
cd apps/cre-workflow && source .env
cast call $SETTLEMENT_VAULT_ADDRESS "getSettlementValue(uint256)(uint256,uint256)" \
  56078938060096976448086754249497300447360333783952000147427828224794011030104 \
  --rpc-url $BASE_TENDERLY_RPC
```

**5. Dashboard**

```bash
cd apps/dashboard && bun dev  # localhost:5173
```
